I am currently a **research engineer** at [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/) and a PhD student with the IMAGINE lab at École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (ENPC) working on the topic of *4D Human Pose and Shape Estimation from LiDAR data*. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Nermin Samet](https://nerminsamet.github.io/) on the valeo.ai lab side and [Prof. David Picard](https://davidpicard.github.io/) on the IMAGINE lab side. Previously, I have been and intern and then a research engineer at [NAVER LABS Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/) in the 3D Humans team. I have obtained my MSc in decision theory from [Université Paris Dauphine - PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/) and my engineering degree in Industrial Computing and Automation from the [National Institute of Applied Science and Technology (INSAT)](https://www.insat.rnu.tn/).
